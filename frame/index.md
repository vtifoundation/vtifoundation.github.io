# VTI Frame

VTI Frame defines the architectural primitives and invariants required to model
trust as verifiable infrastructure.

It establishes:
- Canonical trust-state representation
- Trust Envelope and Authorization Envelope primitives
- Lineage and evidence propagation rules
- Verification independence requirements

VTI Frame is architectural and descriptive.
It does not prescribe implementation details.
